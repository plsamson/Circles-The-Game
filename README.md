# Circles

**Circles** is a minimalist action game written purely in C. It uses geometric primitives for rendering, and all animations are computed with trigonometric functions and integral-style calculations.

You control a small triangle navigating through rapidly rotating obstacles—your goal is to survive as long as possible without touching the red arcs.
